First step is we use the *#include* keyword. This keyword indicates that we are going to call some libraries built in C. These libraries are already with C packages whenever you downloaded it in your system.

    #include <stdio.h>

Define your main function. This is the entry point of the code whenever it is executed.

     int main()
     {

     }
